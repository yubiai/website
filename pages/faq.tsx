          </Heading>
          <Text color="white">
            Yubiai utilizes multiple layers of security to ensure a safe and trustworthy marketplace environment:
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            Interface Security: Yubiai employs a secure interface that interacts with the Kleros Escrow smart contract. This interface incorporates special encryption measures to protect sensitive data and transactions.
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            Kleros Escrow: The Kleros Escrow system is a vital component of Yubiai. It securely holds the payment for each transaction in escrow until the buyer and seller are both satisfied with the outcome. If any issues or disputes arise, the dispute resolution process is initiated.
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            Dispute Resolution: In the event of a dispute between the buyer and seller, the Kleros dispute resolution mechanism(built-in the escrow) comes into play. A decentralized panel of jurors examine the evidence provided by both parties and makes a fair and unbiased ruling to resolve the dispute.
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            Verified Accounts: Yubiai implements a badge system to verify the authenticity of user accounts, helping to prevent bots and ensure that transactions occur between real human beings. This adds an extra layer of trust and integrity to the platform.
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            Curate (Not yet implemented): Yubiai plans to introduce a feature called Curate, which will serve as a mechanism for reviewing and approving submitted items. This process will ensure that listings comply with country-specific regulations and meet the required submission criteria. Items that meet the guidelines will be published, while those that don&apos;t will be rejected.
          </Text>
          <Text color="white">
            By combining these layers of security, Yubiai aims to provide a safe and reliable marketplace experience for buyers and sellers. The platform&apos;s commitment to security, dispute resolution and curation helps build trust and ensures a fair and transparent environment for all users.
